        <p>Hello hackers, </p>
        <p>
            We are excited to announce that, as of September 2021, TechHacks and Council of Digital Engineers (CODE) have entered an agreement to form a new organization called TechCodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the merger with CODE, we will be able to provide higher quality events, better engagements and accomplish our mission of inspiring everyone to computer science regardless of their backgrounds. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past few years, TechHacks have hosted numerous hackathons and coding events that have reached hundreds of people both within the founding institution as well as the city. Weâ€™d like to thank all members who had participated in our events and helped strengthen the STEM community.   
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the new organization, we will continue to make coding events and competitions accessible to everyone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope to see you in TechCodes soon,
        </p>
        <p>TechHacks Team</p>
